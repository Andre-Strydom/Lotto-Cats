## The plan

Lotto-Cats will is a monthly run lottery that will eventualy be used to raise funds for charitys that allow blockchain donation. Each month a mint will be held were a percentage of the funds raised will be given to a charity wich will be voted on by the community. The community will also be voting on the Reward Structure for the fund for .

## Why should I buy a OG Lotto-Cat?

As a thank you for getting us started, any owner of an OG Lotto-Cat wil always be allowed to mint their Cat early for the monthly Lottery. As Lotto Cats has no Whitelist or presale roles, this will be the only way to get an advantage moving forward.

## The plan

- 3000 NFTS
- 0.5 Sol per Mint
- 75% to the Lottery 
- 20% to the Creators
- 5% to Charity voted for by the community
- Equal chance to win regardless of NFT
- Comunity will vote on the amount of winners and what percentage of the prize pool each winner will get.



## When

If you're reading this the mint should be live. Getting one should be easy, people shouldn't have to grind for a whitelist spot or have to resort to making fake accounts to increase their Discord Level. Once all 3000 Mints are sold, a draw will be held. 


## Why

A Lottery system felt like a fun way to raise the funds for charity while doing something I love, building web3 projects. The first mint has only a small percentage going to charitable contributions, but I will be increasing this percentage and reducing the amount alocated to the team going forward as we need the initial funds to get the infrustructure in place to make  Lotto-Cats a long term charatable fund-raising protocoll.
