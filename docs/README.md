 Welcome to Lotto-Cats!

## What is Lotto-Cats?

Lotto-Cats is a monthly run lottery that will be used to raise funds for charities. Each month a mint will be held, then a percentage of the funds raised will be donated to a charity voted for by the community. Some funds will go to the team for managing the project, but the majority(75%) will go into the Lottery. Owning that months nft will enter you into the draw.

## Why should I buy a Lotto-Cat?

Other than the chance to win 1250 Sol and helping us build a charity, as a thank you for getting us started, any owner of an OG Lotto-Cat will be allowed to mint any future Lotto-Cats early each month. Lotto-Cats has no, nor ever will have a Whitelist or presale. Owning a OG cat  will be the only way to get an advantage moving forward.

## The Mint

- 3333 NFTS
- 0.5 Sol per Mint
- 75% to the Lottery
- 20% to the Creators
- 5% to Charity voted for by the community
- Equal chance to win regardless of NFT
- Before the draw takes place, holders will vote on the amount of winners and what percentage of the prize pool each winner will get.
- Holders will vote for the charity receiving the donation.



## When

If you're reading this the mint should be live. Getting one should be easy, people shouldn't have to grind for a whitelist spot or have to resort to making fake accounts to increase their Discord Level. Once all 3333 Mints are sold, a draw will be held.


## Why

A Lottery system felt like a fun way to raise the funds for charity while doing something I love, building web3 projects. The first mint has a small percentage going to charitable contributions, but I will be increasing this percentage by reducing the amount allocated to the team going forward. Right now we need the initial funds to get the infrastructure in place to make Lotto-Cats a long term charitable fund-raising protocol.


## Special Thanks

I just want to thank you for taking the time to read my docs, and if you purchased a Lotto-Cat, shared the product or even just joined the discord, you are a Rockstar! Thanks for bringing me one step closer to achieving my dreams as well as making the world a better place!
