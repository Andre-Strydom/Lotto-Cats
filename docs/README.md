## The plan

- 10000 NFTS
- 0.5 Sol per Mint
- 65% to the Lottery 
- 10% for planting trees to offset the emmesions
- 25% to the Creators
- Equal chance to win regardless of NFT
- Comunity will vote on the amount of winners and what percentage of the prize pool each winner will get.

## When

If you're reading this the mint should be live. Getting one should be easy, people shouldn't have to grind for a whitelist spot or have to resort to making fake accounts to increase their Discord Level. Once all 10000 Mints are sold, a draw will be held. 


## Why

A Lottery system felt like a fun way to raise the funds I need, while still adding utility to the project. The funds raised by Lotto-Cats will be used on a larger project I am planning to build that requires a bigger team. Owning a lotto cat however will give no advantage for that project, other than knowing about said project early, and the chance to win your share of 3250 Sol.


## Special Thanks

I just want tho thank you for taking the time to read my docs, and if you purchased a Lotto-Cat, shared the product or even just joined the discord, you are a Rockstar! Thanks for bringing me 1 step closer to achieving my dreams!
